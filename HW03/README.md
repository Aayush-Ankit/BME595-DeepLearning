#HW03 - 

###1. The theta values arrived from training were similar to HW02 values. It was just sclaed down version with similar ratios as HW02.
###2. Training Time for Iso-error - XOR > OR > AND > NOT
###3. For Digit recognition on MNIST, following figures show the errors (training and cross-validation MSE) and the classification accuracy.
