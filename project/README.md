# Title
Exploring Conditional Deep Belief Networks (DBN) for Energy Efficiency

## Team members
Aayush Ankit (Aayush-Ankit), Priyadarshini Panda (panda1230)

### Goals
Develop conditional stacked auto-encoders for energy-efficient training and testing. Verify the proposed framework for different data-sets and across different computation platforms.

## Challenges
Coming up with a low-overhead and scalable framework to add the conditional control-knobs in any general DBN.
