Exploring Neural Network Pruning for Energy-Efficient Hardware realizations

## Team members
Aayush Ankit (Aayush-Ankit), Chankyu Lee

### Goals
ANalyze the effect of network pruning on neural network's accuracy, training effort and parameter reduction.

## Challenges
Coming up with modules - nn.Prune to add a pruining layer in the ConvNet and MLPs
